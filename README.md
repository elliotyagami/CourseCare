#CourseCare

## Inspiration

Recently my college has started using online platforms like techtud.com for some courses. It is platform where students can post their query and get answers from the instructor.  Or the instructor can post some article or course related material whenever they want. But it is more or less a discussion forum. 
It is would have been better if the platform provided some real-time collaboration like video lecture, chats etc. So, this is what CourseCare is about.

## Flow

On visiting the main page of CourseCare, one has to choose to continue as a student or tutor.
Then signup or login as that role and users will be redirected to their respective profiles.
